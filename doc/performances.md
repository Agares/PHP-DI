# Performances

## A note about caching

Since PHP-DI 6.0 there is no caching system anymore. Instead the container can be compiled (see below), which allows for even better performances than caching.

## Compiling the container

PHP-DI performs two tasks that can be expensive:

- reading definitions from your [configuration](php-definitions.md), from [autowiring](autowiring.md) or from [annotations](annotations.md)
- resolving those definitions to create your services

In order to avoid those two tasks, the container can be compiled into PHP code optimized especially for your configuration and your classes.

### Setup

Compiling the container is as easy as calling the `compile()` method on the container builder:

```php
$containerBuilder = new \DI\ContainerBuilder();
$containerBuilder->compile(__DIR__ . '/var/cache/CompiledContainer.php');

// [â€¦]

$container = $containerBuilder->build();
```

The `compile()` method takes a single argument: the name of a file in which to store the container.

Please note that the file name will also be the name of the generated PHP class. Because of that the filename you specify must also be a valid class name. For example:

- `var/cache/CompiledContainer.php`: valid
- `var/cache/compiled-container.php`: invalid since `compiled-container` is not a valid PHP class name

### Deployment in production

When a container is configured to be compiled, **it will be compiled once and never be regenerated again**. That allows for maximum performances in production.

When you deploy new versions of your code to production **you must delete the generated file** to ensure that the container is re-compiled.

If your production handles a lot of traffic you may also want to generate the compiled container *before* the new version of your code goes live. That phase is known as the "warmup" phase. To do this, simply create the container (call `$containerBuilder->build()`) during your deployment step and the compiled container will be created.

### Development environment

**Do not compile the container in a development environment**, else all the changes you make to the definitions (annotations, configuration files, etc.) will not be taken into account. Here is an example of what you can do:

```php
$containerBuilder = new \DI\ContainerBuilder();
if (/* is production */) {
    $containerBuilder->compile(__DIR__ . '/var/cache/CompiledContainer.php');
}
```

As a side note, do not confuse "development environment" with your automated tests. You are encouraged to run your automated tests (PHPUnit, Behat, etc.) on a system as close to your production setup (which means with the container compiled).

### Optimizing for compilation

As you can read in the "*How it works*" section, PHP-DI will take all the definitions it can find and compile them. That means that definitions like autowired classes that are not listed in the configuration cannot be compiled since PHP-DI doesn't know about them.

If you want to optimize performances to a maximum in exchange for more verbosity, you can let PHP-DI know about all the autowired classes by listing them in definition files:

```php
return [
    // ... (your definitions)

    UserController::class => autowire(),
    BlogController::class => autowire(),
    ProductController::class => autowire(),
    // ...
];
```

You do not need to configure them (autowiring will still take care of that) but at least now PHP-DI will know about those classes and will compile their definitions.

Currently PHP-DI does not traverse directories to find autowired or annotated classes automatically. It also does not resolve [wildcard definitions](php-definitions.md#wildcards) when it is compiled.

Please note that the following definitions are not compiled (yet):

- [decorator definitions](php-definitions.md#decoration)
- [wildcard definitions](php-definitions.md#wildcards)

Those definitions will still work perfectly, they will simply not get a performance boost when using a compiled container.

On the other hand factory definitions (either defined with closures or with class factories) are supported in the compiled container. However please note that if you are using closures as factories:

- you should not use `$this` inside closures
- you should not import variables inside the closure using the `use` keyword, like in `function () use ($foo) { ...`

These limitations exist because the code of each closure is copied into the compiled container. It is safe to say that you should probably not do these things even if you do not compile the container.

### How it works

PHP-DI will read definitions from your [configuration](php-definitions.md). When the container is compiled, PHP code will be generated based on those definitions.

For example let's take the definition for creating an object:

```php
return [
    'Logger' => DI\create()
        ->constructor('/tmp/app.log')
        ->method('setLevel', 'warning'),
];
```

This definition will be compiled to PHP code similar to this:

```php
$object = new Logger('/tmp/app.log');
$object->setLevel('warning');
return $object;
```

All the compiled definitions will be dumped into a PHP class (the compiled container) which will be written to a file (for example `CompiledContainer.php`).

At runtime, the container builder will see that the file `CompiledContainer.php` exists and will load it (instead of loading the definition files). That PHP file may contain a lot of code but PHP's opcode cache will cache that class in memory (remember to use opcache in production). When a definition needs to be resolved, PHP-DI will simply execute the compiled code and return the created instance.
